        <h2>First "Official" Blog Post</h2>

        <p class="postText">I've dabbled with keeping or journal or blog in the past but, as the title of my blog would explain, I never really stuck with it.  Now that I am getting deeper into the Web Dev world I am using a blog as my practice project to reinforce what I am learning throughout this journey.  I toyed with the idea of keeping it centered around a certain theme or topic, but the more I think about it that just seems like a recipe for a disaster.  With that said, this will be my daily (fingers crossed) exercise of jotting down whatever is on my mind.  Literally, anything.  Whether I want to talk about a new game that I have been playing, or rant about something that happened to me at the supermarket, this blog will be the public stomping ground of my internal monologue.  That pretty much covers the "why".  Let's talk about the "who" a little bit.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="postText">For those of you that don't know me, my name is Emilio and I am a nerdy, introverted, music loving video game head.  I am 29 and I live in New York City.  My family is from Puerto Rico but I was born and raised here.  I currently work in IT as a help desk tech but I'd eventually start my own business.  Hopefully, that new business will be as a developer as some sort.  Whether it will be front end, back end or full stack, who knows?  As long as it involved some type of coding I will be a happy camper.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="postText">I did it.  An actual blog post that doesn't consist of some Lorem Ipsum placeholder text.  While I pat myself on the back I also would like to  thank you for taking the time to read this and hope you'll come back to see where else this crazy ride will take me </p>
